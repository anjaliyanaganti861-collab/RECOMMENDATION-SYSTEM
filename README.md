# DESCRIPTION
This project presents a Movie Recommendation System built using collaborative filtering techniques, specifically leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization. The primary goal of this system is to recommend movies to users based on their past preferences, by analyzing patterns in the ratings of similar users or items. The system is developed using the Surprise library, which is a powerful Python scikit specifically built for building and analyzing recommender systems.

We utilize the MovieLens 100k dataset, a popular benchmark dataset in the recommender systems domain. This dataset contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies. Each user has rated at least 20 movies. The dataset also includes metadata such as movie titles and genres, which is used to make the output more meaningful and interpretable.

The core recommendation engine is based on matrix factorization using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). Matrix factorization is a widely adopted technique in collaborative filtering, where the goal is to factorize the user-item interaction matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices that capture latent features of users and items. These features help predict how a user might rate an unseen item.

# RESULTS
shows the top 5 recommended movies for a subset of users. For each user, a table is generated using tabulate, which neatly presents: The movie title The estimated rating the user would give The genres the movie belongs to

This structured output is not only helpful in evaluating the systemâ€™s suggestions but also makes it easier for non-technical stakeholders (e.g., managers, external reviewers, or internship evaluators) to understand the effectiveness of the system.
